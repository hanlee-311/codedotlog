Codedotlog is an app for developers to set learning goals and keep track of their progress towards completing their goals. Developers can log hours dedicated to their coding practice of a particular language or skill and monitor their progress.

## User Story
As a fresh graduate of a coding bootcamp:
* I want to continue practicing and tracking my coding learnings.
* I want to be able to set multiple hourly goals for the coding languages and skills I want to work on.
* I want to be able to log how many hours I've dedicated to each coding language or skill.
* I want to be able to easily view my progress towards my goals.
* I want to be able to update my goals at any time.
* I want a weekly progress report at the end of each week that displays my progress towards a goal.

## Goal
As developers:
* We wanted to build an application that would help us and our peers to continue and track our coding learning post graduation. 
* We wanted to build an application with a sleek, clean design that would be eye-catching and easy to use.


## Technologies Used
* React
* MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM
* Styled Components
* ChartJS
* GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server
* DayJS
* Heroku
 
 
## Work Completed

* Barbara worked on JavaScript and the logic for connecting our front-end and back-end.
* Hannah worked on our database, setting up Models and MongoDB.
* Ryan worked on Styled Components, CSS, and our Presentation.
* Teisha worked on Front-End Components, the Weekly Modal, and the README file.
 
 
## Challenges and Successes

Some of the challenges we experienced with this project were:
1. Making the project responsive with CSS.
2. Figuring out how to lift up the state and pass it through multiple components to dynamically render data to the chart.
3. The update goal mutation, 

There were also many successes to this project:
1. Ryan's inital design gave us a great base to work from and made it easy for the project to come together.
2. Getting our private routes to work, as well as our APIs and contact form
3. Deployment to Heroku
4. Our overall communication as a team. We kept each other up to date on what we were working on and where we were blocked. We also did a great job at helping each other become unblocked and figuring out bugs and issues.


## Future Application Updates

* Give users to the option to Delete, Abandon, or Save a goal for later.
* Add Badges for goal completion and mastery levels based on how many hours a user has completed towards a goal.
* Add a Donate button that integrates with Stripe.
* Allow users to compare their progress with other users.
